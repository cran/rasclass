rasclass 0.2.2
==============

 * Fixed working directory issue on ReadRasterFolder. The previous working directory
   is now set on exit of the function.

rasclass 0.2.1
===========

 * Fixed a bug in the Maximum Likelihood Classifier. Previously, zero variation of one
   input variable over a class would set the classification probability of the whole
   class to zero. In the corrected version the variable with no variation is ignored for
   prediction of the corresponding class, but probabilities are not automatically zero.
 * Added a progress bar to the Maximum Likelihood Classifier.
