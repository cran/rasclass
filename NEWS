rasclass 0.2.0
===========

 * The number of classification algorithms has been increased from two to five. The
   additional methods are Neural Networks, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines.
 * The functions classifyMlogit() and classifyMLC() have been unified and extended
   in the function classifyRasclass(). The classification algorithm can be chosen
   using the optional argument 'method'.
 * The function setRasclassData() now allows to add data to a rasclass-class object
   from data in a dataframe. In future updates, an integration with the 'raster'
   package is planned.
